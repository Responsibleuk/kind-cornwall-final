                    The crime investigation software that I built at Capital One is my favorite. I knew
                    everyday, that we were building software that made the world a safer place.

                    <br><br>

                    The team was also a huge part of why Capital One was amazing. I thought my team at
                    Caterpillar was amazing, but sometimes too competitive. At Capital One, nobody competed
                    against each other, we all worked together as a team.

                    <br><br>

                    Another thing that stood out in this project was that we pushed the technical
                    boundaries. During my first sprint my boss told me to rewrite the foundation of the
                    framework to make it responsive. Except there was a twist, he told me that I could not
                    use relative, absolute, fixed or static positioning. I could only use Flexbox for making
                    the web application responsive. So I pushed the boundaries of what we even thought was
                    possible with Flexbox. In the end, we created a web application that acted more like a
                    desktop application.
